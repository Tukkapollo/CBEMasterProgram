What is:
Container management tool. Can handle large number or containers in a more manageable way.
Useful when working with containerized microservices.

Benefits:
High availability
Scalability
Disaster recovery

Structure:
Node{
Pod
	-smallest unit
	-usually 1 application
	-each pod gets ip address
	
service:
	-permanent IP address
		-benefit: pod always gets the same IP
	-can be external or internal
		-external reachable from outside k8s
		
ingress:
	-makes service address more production viable. (https and no port)
	
ConfigMAp:
	-essentially ini-file for pods. use it with -configMapRef in pod yaml
	
Secret:
	-store credentials etc. that are bae64 encoded
}
Information is lost like this, upon closure of node. To remedy the situation:
Volumes
	-Data generated and used in k8s cluseter must be saved outside of the cluster for storing.
	
-Replicas
	-Work as a load balancer

-StatefulSet
	-Alternative to deployment, used for databases etc. so that all pods have access to the same data
	-Can instead use deployments and read external database. Note; not pure microservice
