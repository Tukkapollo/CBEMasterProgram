Hi I have checked the progress; you have improved a lot, and that work sounds really interesting. 
Good you can keep the company as a case:

here are some suggestions on how to improve the content regarding the academic quality

Strengthen Theoretical Foundations

Integrate software engineering theories relevant to legacy system modernization, such as ||||||technical debt management||||||, 
||||||software maintainability models (ISO/IEC 25010)||||||, and software evolution theories.Include economic and business considerations, 
such as |||cost-benefit analysis methodologies||| and return on investment (ROI) models for software migration, in the part where you 
analyze the need to migrate.
Expand Methodology with a Stronger Case Study Approach

Provide a structured methodology section detailing data collection techniques (semi-structured interviews, document analysis, 
system performance evaluation). Compare your case with similar cases in existing literature, identifying common challenges 
and solutions and Discuss industry trends regarding legacy system migration and how companies in different sectors approach
modernization.

Deepen the Migration Strategy Analysis

Evaluate migration strategies such as ||||||big-bang vs. incremental migration and discuss the trade-offs between them||||||. Provide a structured 
roadmap that includes risk assessment, testing strategies, and post-migration evaluation. Discuss the potential impact of your roadmap on 
software maintainability, developer productivity, and business operations. Suggest future research directions, such as AI-driven migration 
automation or model-driven engineering for legacy systems. 

Incorporating these elements will make your thesis even better compared to academic research standards. BTW, a more classic table of 
contents with clear sections like literature review, methodologies, results, and implications can be easier for the reader too. I hope 
till the end of next month you can finalize it, Let me know when you have the results and conclusion parts more finalized.
